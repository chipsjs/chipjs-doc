# Chips-Doc Read Module

## Introduction

Chips-Doc-Reader is a  tool to provide API workflow and swagger for our API documentation. It supports three application scenarios.

First of all, it displays the deployed API. Chips-Doc can auto-sync and convert API-documentation from spec to swagger.  Secondly,  it displays the developing API so that it can be provided to the mobile team to develop. Finally,  It shows the workflow for APIs or some more detailed information because it is based on the redoc framework.
